# Music_Recommendation_System

Since the very beginnning I have been into music a lot. Now i cannot play many instruments but I listen to a lot of it. 

I pretty much know all of Hindi music and really like English and Punjabi too!

This time I thought why not use what i have learnt and create a recommender system for myself but this time use music instead!

So i created my own Music Recommendation System from scratch and for it I used my own Library. 
I created a csv file containing information about all the songs i had in my library and worked on it. 

I am uploading the dataset too for anyone else who is using it and I will try to keep it updated as i add more music to my library. 

The dataset is uploaded in my_music.csv file and the code is located in the .ipynb file. 

Check it out and let me know how it is!
